Documentation and pointers

In this lab, we'll be modifying our lorem ipsum generator to take cli input using the flags packages.

1. Read the "Overview" Section of [the flag package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/flag/)
1. Create "words" and a "sentence-length" as cli flags with your origional hardcoded values as their defaults.
1. Replace the hardcoded inputs to the `generateIpsum` function with the variables you bind to these flags.
